# VSCodium

I use [VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) instead of VSCode.

Most of my setup has been inspired by Caleb Porzio's excellent [Make VSCode Awesome](https://makevscodeawesome.com/) course.

## Custom CSS

In order to enable Custom CSS, run the following commands first:

```sh
sudo chown -R $(whoami) "$(which codium)"
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/share/codium
```
